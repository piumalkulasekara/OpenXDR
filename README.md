<!-- Scalable Anomaly Dection System

OpenADS is a Big Data analytics framework designed to consume and monitor network traffic and mine hidden anomalies using advanced machine learning techniques. In current date, OpenADS is still at it's conceptual stage where it is designed to work at a massive scale. The system believes to act as an extensible and reliable platform to enrich traditional Intrusion Detection System (IDS). OpenADS is unique at it's nature with the architecture supported by Berkeley Data Stack (BDS).
